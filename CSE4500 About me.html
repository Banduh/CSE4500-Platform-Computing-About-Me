    <h2>Quick info</h2>
    <p>
    Hello my name is Bryan Tran I am 20 years old and Vietnamese. Currently I am studying computer information systems at CSUSB and I also work as a pharmacy technician at CVS. 
    When I'm not at school or working I really like to play games or sometimes just do nothing because I don't know what to do. The game I'm playing right now is Palworld.

            I'm currently a third year here at California State University of San Bernardino. I am currently majoring in computer information systerms with a concentration on administration.
            After getting my degree I am looking forward to exploring the cyber security field. It's something that has always interested me and I want to pursue it as my career. Also
            it's nice that CSUSB has a cyber security program and department.

    <h2>Goals for this class</h2>
    <p>
    The reason I took this class is because it is a requirement because I needed it to fill an elective slot. Secondly I thought it was one of the more interesting class. All the other
    classes being offered just didn't seem that interesting to me. So I went with this one because it was interesting and I was curious to know what it was about.
